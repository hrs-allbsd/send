 * A buffered source of randomness. Experiments show that reads to
 * /dev/[u]random can be expensive, so to ensure that time critical
 * operations (such as puzzle-I selection needed to send an R1) are
 * fast, we read instead from a bufer which is populated asynchronously
 * from /dev/urandom by a thread. The thread will refill the buffer
 * whenever more than half the buffer has been read. If you find that
 * on a busy server rand requests outstrip the buffer refilling thread,
 * increase the buffer size.
 * Switch to /dev/random? Need more experience with blocking times...
