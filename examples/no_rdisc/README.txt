README.no_rdisc.pdf provides an example of how to create new CGA parameters
and configure sendd when not using router discovery. If you follow that
document, you will end up with two new sets of configuration files.

This directory also contains two pre-baked examples generated by the
proceedure described in README.no_rdisc.pdf. If you just want to get
started quickly and try SEND out, you can use these examples. There
are two sets of configuration files, one each for the fictional hosts
mn1 and mn2. Use the mn1 files on your first host:

# cp sendd.conf.mn1 /etc/sendd.conf
# mkdir /etc/sendd
# cp mn1.* /etc/sendd

Repeat using mn2 files for your second host.

You can get the CGA addresses corresponding to these configuration files
using cgatool. Here is the address for "mn1":

# cgatool --gen -D mn1.cga.params -k mn1.key.pem -o /tmp/der -s 1 -p 2003::
2003::3049:deeb:fd31:70b0

And for "mn2":

# cgatool --gen -D mn2.cga.params -k mn2.key.pem -o /tmp/der -s 1 -p 2003::
2003::206d:250:e986:4ab4

You can configure these addresses on your interfaces, start sendd, and try
pinging between your hosts. (Just remember to make sure the packet divert
mechanism is in place for your OS. Also remember to sync your clocks - one
easy way is `ntpdate clock.redhat.com`).
