 * For add requests, the parameters can either be for an address or  new

 *
 * Next, for both named and address parameters, if source is "used",
 * one string follows the header:
 * 1. Name to use.
 *
 * If the source is "explicit", two strings follow the header, in this order:
 * 1. CGA paramaters file name
 * 2. Private key file name
 *
 * For delete requests, the add headers are reused. For an addr deletion,
 * no strings follow the header. For a named deletion, one string follows

 *
 * The sec member is ignored if the source is "used".
 * All integers are in host byte order.
 * All strings are NULL-terminated.
